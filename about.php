<h3>What we do</h3>
<p>We are are glad you found our page and are interested in our work. We are committed in helping our community
and saving our environment. The amount of waste being thrown away is simply astonishing. We want to work with you to 
keep our cities clean, save the everglades and contribute back to the community all at the same time.</p>

<p>Every item that you recycle helps one member in your city put food on the table. With your help we can help aide
those who depend on recycling to survive. Thanks to our many sponsors and contributors we are able to do this free of charge</p>

<p>We want to breathe cleaner air, help vulnerable members in our community and aide our planet.
You can help us by simply putting recyclable items in the right place.</p>
